				   <p>
				   	<b>The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky</b>
					Fiction but real. This book is so intriguing and brutally honest. It shows the struggle of a high school teenager. Not about school and stuff but the real struggle. About how confused and lost one may feel. About how a kid with perfect grades can be sad and may feel lost. This book will help you gain a different perspective of looking into certain things and people around you. A must-read for all ages.

					<b>Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions by Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche</b>
					 Being a very quick read, I’m sure you would want to keep this handy. This book is more personal being non-fiction. I would want every person on this planet to read this particular book and I cannot emphasize more. This is not a regular book on Feminism. In case you like it, please do read, “We should all be feminists” by the same author.

				<p>
					<b>Sita’s Sister by Kavita Kane</b>
				 Ever since I have started reading Kavita Kane’s books, I have become a fan of hers. This book will give you a new outlook towards Ramayana. Sita’s Sister is a courageous re-creation of mythology, which presents us with a subaltern viewpoint. It seems to be written in response to Lakshman’s burning question O Urmila! Will the world ever know of your inner suffering, your divine sacrifice? yet it is not just her version. Every character is given space and voice, even if the author does not let them break free from the fabric they were originally, or turn the events of the story accordingly.
